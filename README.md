## Variational Monte Carlo on bosonic systems
The source code for project 1 is located in [project_1/vmc](project_1/vmc). The article can be found in
[project_1/article](project_1/article). Most of the data is produced using Jupyter Notebooks and shows
examples on how to run the project. These are located in [project_1/notebooks](project_1/notebooks).


## Coupled Cluster Doubles on two-dimensional quantum dots
The source code for project 2 is located in [project_2/coupled-cluster](project_2/coupled-cluster). The
article can be found in [project_2/article](project_2/article). We have used Python scripts and Jupyter
Notebooks to generate the results. They provide examples on how use the programs. The Notebooks are
located in [project_2/notebooks](project_2/notebooks) whereas the scripts are located in
[project_2/scripts](project_2/scripts).
